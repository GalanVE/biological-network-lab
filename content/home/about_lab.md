Biological Network Lab is located at the Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.

The primary research focus of the laboratory is to study biological phenomena from a complex systems perspective. For this, we use different data mining strategies to obtain, preprocess and build data sets, which provide the basis for identifying and building networks. These include Gene Regulatory Networks, Gene Co-expression Networks, Drug and target networks, among others.
